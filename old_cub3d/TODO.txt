the rules of the project:
- must use miniLibX
- window management must remain smooth, changing to another window, minimising etc.
- must have different wall textures (4 in total)
- must display item instead of wall
- must set floor + ceiling to different ones
- --save triggers a bmp screenshot if it is the second argument
- if no second argument is supplied the image turns into a game
	- left right arrow keys to look left and right
	- WASD to mov the POV though the maze
	- ESC to exit the window and quit cleanly
	- clicking on the red cross on the window frame must also close the window and quit cleanly
	- if declared screen size in the map is greater than the displa resolution the window siz will set depending on the current display resolution.
	- the use of images of the miniibX is strongly recommended.

THE PROGRAM ITSELF:
0: empty space
1: wall
2: item
N, S, E, W: player spawn point and orientation

a valid map:
- must be closed (surrounded by walls), if not, error.
- except for map content, each type of element can be separated by one or more empty lines.
- except for map content, which must be set to the last, each type of element can be
  set in any order in the file.
- except for the map, each type of information can be separated by one or more spaces.
- the map must be parsed as it looks like in the file. saes are a valid part of the map!
  must parse any kind of map, as long as it's a valid one.

MAP IDENTIFIERS:
Each element (except the map) firsts information is the type identifier, folowed by specific information for each object
this order is STRICT.

- RESOLUTION:
R x y

- NORTH TEXTURE:
NO ./path_to_the_north_texture

- SOUTH TEXTURE:
SO ./path_to_the_south_texture

- WEST TEXTURE:
