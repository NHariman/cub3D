/*
** map must ONLY contain ' ', 1, 2, or ONE of N, S, E, W.
** a valid map is a map that starts and ends with all 1 and ' '
** and all 0s, NSWE and 2s are completely blocked off from spaces,
** including diagonally.
** the function should be called at the first hint of a 1, indicating
** the start of a map.
** aka. the first time this function is called,
** map[0] should only contain 1 and ' '
** after that the function should check if the middle bits are correct.
** example:
**        xxx
**        x0x
**        xxx
** if a 0 touches a space in any of the x positions the map is invalid.
** a map ends when another row of only 1s and spaces is found.
** the function should know the map is over and still scan the field to
** check for ' ' and 1s as those are still valid even after a map ends.
** if only ' ' and '\n' are found that also means the map has ended,
** if characters are found after that's fine too lol.
** WARNING: ONLY THE MAP THE PLAYER AS ACCESS TO HAS TO BE CLOSED. AKA. FLOODFILL
** STARTING FROM SPAWN POINT!!
